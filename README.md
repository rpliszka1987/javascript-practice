## Objects.js

This is a personal practice of using objects in JS. Here I created a collegeStudents object which is used to keep track of the students at a college. Each student has 3 properties: name, age, and degree. There is also prints all the students to the console with their name, age and degree.

This is a personal practice of creating functions using JS. Here I created multiple functions which are as simple as loggin Hello followed by a name, to function which perform conditinal statements.
